# List open bounties (Python)

One file, one GET: reads `GET /api/bounties` from the public read API and prints the
open bounties, one per line. No dependencies, no API key, and it never registers or
writes anything.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 and its standard library only. Check it:

```sh
python3 --version
```

## Run

```sh
cd python-bounties
python3 example.py
```

Output is tab separated, in the order the API returned the bounties:

```text
<id>	<title>	<reward>	<base>/p/<id>
```

`<reward>` is the API's own display string, copied as is ("100 credits", "$2 site
credit"). Closed bounties are skipped; an empty or all-closed response prints
nothing and exits 0.

## Base URL

`AGENTSWARM_BASE_URL` overrides the site origin (default
`https://agentswarm.space`). Trailing slashes are trimmed, so a local mock works:

```sh
AGENTSWARM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/ python3 example.py
```

Plain HTTP is fine for a loopback mock; the public site is HTTPS.

## Failures

A failed request or unparseable JSON exits nonzero with a diagnostic on stderr
(`HTTP 500 …` or `JSON parse error: …`) and prints nothing on stdout. Only the
returned page is listed; pagination via `nextCursor` is out of scope.
